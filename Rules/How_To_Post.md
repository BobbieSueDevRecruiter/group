# How To Post Questions

This is the text version of the rules. The official rules are in list form:  
[Official Rules](./Rules.md)

The idea of this text is that you do not have to read a list and also get some more advice on how to write good questions and answers. The list has two other advantages: It is directly on facebook (in our group) and it is a list so we can reference the number of a rule.

# Moderation

All posts are reviewed before they appear in the group to be answered. Requests for membership are moderated too.

# Allowed Topics

Posts must be about Java, C, C++, C#, Android, PHP, Computer Science and so on. Always state in your post what topic it is about.

No contest questions, no adverts, no job adverts, no spam, no religious, political, nationalistic, sexist, homophobic, and so on.  
There are other groups for job adverts. Posting them in our group will lead to a permanent ban.

# Language / Code

Posts in standard English only. No slang, txtspk or l33tsp33k.  
It doesn’t have to be perfect English, but at least use complete words and sentences. English is by far the most important Language for you as a computer scientist. Learn it!

Source code should not be directly in the text (unless it’s just two or three lines). Use any of the following sites to paste your code and post a link to it.

*   [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)
*   [gist/github](https://gist.github.com/)
*   [codepad](https://www.codepad.org/)
*   [pastie](http://pastie.org/)

# Example

If your question looks like this it will probably be approved:

* * *

> **John Smith:** [Java/OOP:] I have 3 Java classes: [http://pastebin.com/qQ3Wpkkr](http://pastebin.com/qQ3Wpkkr)  
> I create an object like so:  
> Teacher t = new Teacher(“001”, “Mr. Smith”)  
> Then I want to see the “info” like this:  
> System.out.println(t.getInfo());  
> I get “I’m a Teacher. My ID is null and my name is null”.  
> But I expected “I’m a Teacher. My ID is 001 and my name is Mr. Smith”  
> Where is my mistake? Note that I did use final keyword. Why are both null, even though I never assign null to those fields?

* * *

It is good because:

*   It starts with the topic (in this case: Java and OOP).
*   All code is linked on pastebin.
*   It explains what has been tried out.
*   It tells the actual and the expected output.
*   It describes what has already been tried out (using final keyword).

# How to ask good questions

If you are a raw novice, don’t be afraid to ask – there are no stupid questions.

**State your goal!** That is the most important information to answer your question. This text explains how to ask questions the smart way:  
["How To Ask Questions The Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

Try to provide a _short, self contained, correct example_: ["The SSCCE"](http://sscce.org/)

Tell us what result/output you expect. The compiler and the runtime rarely do anything wrong, so don’t claim the output is _wrong_. It isn’t – your code is.

Before you ask, **use Google** and read your Java **textbook**, and the [Java API specs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/ "Java™ Platform, Standard Edition 8 API Specification"). There’s no point in asking something that can be answered by a quick google search.

If you are looking for a book or software then check our [top recommended java books](../Books/Recommended_Books.md "Top Recommended Java Books") instead of opening a new thread.

Start your post with the topic (e.g. OOP, Android, Networking).  
[Don’t start with “Can I …”. If you could, you wouldn’t have to ask.](http://java-queries.rhcloud.com/can-i/ "Can I …?")  
[Don’t start with “How can I …”. There are a million ways, we can’t list all.](http://java-queries.rhcloud.com/how-can-i/ "How can I … ?") Instead, state how you want to do it.  
Don’t start with “Is is possible …” – it is in most cases.  
Generally don’t ask anything that can be answered by:  

> **“Yes, by writing the appropriate code.”**

**We do not provide code!** Do not ask people to do your assignment – we won’t. We will help you to do it. If your project is due in two days, and you haven’t started yet – Forget it!

Make your question **clear and precise**. Allow us to [see your code](http://java-queries.rhcloud.com/how-to-paste-source-code/ "How to paste Source Code") and all error messages / stack traces.  
(see: [How to print Stack Trace in Java](http://java-queries.rhcloud.com/stack-trace/ "How to print Stack Trace in Java") )

Do not tag people by name in questions. We all answer when we have the time, not when someone annoys us with tagged questions.

Do not ask, nor provide, information to achieve illegal goals, including sharing copyrighted stuff.

The goal of this group is **not** to promote your own blog or software.

# How to answer questions

Be friendly and diplomatic.

Make certain your answer is correct. Incorrect answers and links to bad websites/blogs are deleted.

Do not supply code unless the OP has shown theirs. Do not supply student projects.

Closed threads are closed, and further posts will be deleted.

Do not reply to old threads (‘necro-bumping’).

Do not ask a new question in an existing thread – start a new thread.  
But do not duplicate threads if there is one on the same question.

Check our blog for suggested books and useful links.

Avoid trolling. Don’t contribute to flame wars.

Please avoid posts denigrating other languages, IDEs or operating systems. We do not need the flame wars.

# Membership

Membership requests will be linked to the number of groups you are a member of. 50 max will be allowed. Someone who is in 300 groups probably just wants to promote something.

Do not send members private messages (without their consent) about your questions. Post your questions in the group, and don’t clutter their message boxes.

We can remove or ban you at any time and we do not need to inform you about it or give any reasons. Remember: We do this voluntarily in our free time.
